# Inputs
Instead of using command line tools to handle pipelines and keep track of configurations at 
[The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/pipelines.html?highlight=argparse) suggests, 
I prefer to use TOML configuration files. Keep those files here and then just run the appropriate input 
file for a specific computation.
